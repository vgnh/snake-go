# snake-go

A simple [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game, built using [Go](https://go.dev/) and [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go), the Golang bindings for [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). \
This was built mainly to get a hang of raylib.. \
__There's no game over in this! :D__
